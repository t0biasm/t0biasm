# Hands dirty, code clean!
## About myself
I'm an engineer who bridges the gap between hardware and software—combining mechatronics with modern development practices to build embedded systems that actually work in the real world.
My Background

## How I found my way
My journey started with a bachelor's in `Mechanical Engineering`, where I focused on mechatronics. From there, I pursued a master's in `Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence`, diving deep into control techniques, reinforcement learning, and autonomous driving. My thesis explored trajectory tracking for linear systems using reinforcement learning—work I completed as part of BMW's master scholarship program.
Through my studies, I discovered something important: while talented software developers are plentiful, fewer combine coding skills with genuine understanding of hardware and electronic systems. That's where I found my niche.

## Personal carrer
I've spent my career in embedded software development, working on systems where software meets power electronics. I've developed for battery management systems and high-voltage DC/DC converters (800V), and I'm currently back again on ADAS ECU systems where reliability and precision aren't optional.

I approach problems with both hands-on practical knowledge and clean code principles. Whether it's debugging a circuit or optimizing an algorithm, I believe in understanding the full picture.

## Beyond Engineering
I stay active through different kind of sports like running, swimming, fitness, skiing, volleyball, soccer and much more. 

I wrench on cars in my spare time and take on DIY woodworking projects equipping some areas of my appartment. For me, working with my hands — whether with tools or code  — keeps me grounded.

I value down-to-earth collaboration, clean organization, and thoughtful work that considers both people and the planet. Engineering is problem-solving, but it's also about doing things the right way.

## What you'll find within my GitHub account

I've setted up a repository, which serves as generic platform to build up different kind of embedded SW projects in a quick and easy manner. It's structured into different kind of parts, which shall serve as a kit to stack and assemble a whole SW for different kind of MCUs and platforms
